# RandomDotOrg

Haskell bindings to the [RANDOM.ORG](https://random.org) Core API (Release 4).
The API provides access to a true random number generator (TRNG) based on
atmospheric noise.

NB: The use of the API's services is subject to the terms and conditions of
Randomness and Integrity Services Limited.

An example of use of the library is provided in the `example` folder.

This package and its repository have no connection with Randomness and Integrity
Services Limited or its affilates or the RANDOM.ORG domain.
